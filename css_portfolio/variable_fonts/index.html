        <b><p style="font-family:verdana">He lived in a pineapple, under the sea</p></b>
    <i><p style="font-family:'Courier New'">He was a boating school failure, yet the best fry cook at the Krusty Krab</p></i>

        His best friend is Patrick, and his neighbor Squidward hates him, but we all know Squidward has a soft spot for the yellow sponge</p>
        <p> Spongebob was the longest kids cartoon still airing new episodes in 2019, and has been around for 20 years. Everything about Spongebob is fantastic, especially the love hate relationship Mr. Krabs and Plankton, especially since Spongebob was supposed to be an adult swim show and Patrick and Spongebob were supposed to be gay, and we all know Mr. Krabs and Plankton love to battle each other toooooo much
